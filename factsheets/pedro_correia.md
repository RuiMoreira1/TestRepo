# Factsheet for Pedro Correia

## Sprint 0

In this sprint I have set up the project structure with the docker containers ([Setup docker containers](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/commit/af60e4b694fda0c811b290de1064ebe1df8f6703)) with [André Pereira](andre_pereira.md) and wrote the [technology section](../docs/development.md#technology) of the documentation. Together with [Adriano Soares](adriano_soares.md), we configured the formatters (black and prettier) and linters (pylint and eslint) ([chore: configure formatters and linters](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/commit/fa93978b6adf9c75dbe430b401478429b95949cb)). I also set up a git hook ([chore: setup git hook for formatting and linters](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/commit/c89a7ff03370fb9baf0dea3345b8e20b421f9f5e)) to ensure those tools are run before every commit. Moreover, I complemented the development guide ([chore: make git hook formatters abort commit instead of changing files](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/37#issuecomment-1279594809)).

I have actively tried to help my teammates and even colleagues from other teams, either by helping with technical issues (namely the set up of the git hook) or by giving feedback to their work. Some of this is evidenced in the repository ([chore: make git hook formatters abort commit instead of changing files](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/37#issuecomment-1279594809)), but part was also done during class or in the class' Discord server.

Given the distribution of the work in user stories agreed in a reunion between the SPOs, my team was only responsible for writting the acceptance tests of a given set of user stories. This was compensated by having more work in the other areas of the project.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

-   [#26](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/#26) (Refined) - Wrote the acceptance tests.
-   [#15](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/#15) (Refined) - Reviewed and refined acceptance tests.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

-   [#6](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/#6) (Implemented) - My work in this pull request was building upon what was done by [Adriano Soares](adriano_soares.md) ([Style: configure formatters and linters and respective github actions](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/3/commits/d932274a20ad63027dbaab3413fa06fc4530e518)). That is, I separated the formatting from the configuration of formatters and linters into two different commits, I added linters and formatters as dev dependencies to the repository and added the git hook.
-   [#10](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/10#pullrequestreview-1143064123) (Reviewed) - Reviewed and made suggestions.

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

-   Set up the project structure with the docker containers ([Setup docker containers](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/commit/af60e4b694fda0c811b290de1064ebe1df8f6703)) with [André Pereira](andre_pereira.md)
-   Actively tried to help my teammates and even colleagues from other teams by helping with technical issues, in the repository ([chore: make git hook formatters abort commit instead of changing files](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/37#issuecomment-1279594809)), during class and in the class' Discord server.

## Sprint 1

This sprint I have set up acception and unit tests (with help of [Fernando Rego](fernando_rego.md)) and created their github actions. I proposed a retrospective template [#73](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/73) and was tasked with implementing the user story [#19](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/19) along with [Mario Travassos](mario_travassos.md) and [Joel Fernandes](joel_fernandes.md). As in last sprint, I helped team members and members of other teams in technical difficulties and other issues. I have also made an effort to ensure that the repository documentation is up to date.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

-   [#19](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/19) (Implemented) - Implemented the backend and helped testing the interation between the backend and frontend, as well as resolving technical issues.
-   [#148](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/148) (Wrote) - Wrote the user story text (As a... I want... So that...) and refined acceptance tests.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

-   [#93](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/93) (Implemented) - Implementation of backend routes for Workstations and answered the reviews that were made.
-   [#60](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/60) (Reviewed) - Reviewed, asked for some clarifications and pointed out issues I ran into while testing locally.

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

-   I have proposed (and included feedback from other team members) a retrospective strategy to be followed by all teams and respective template [#73](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/73).
-   I have set up gherkin acceptance tests with help of [Fernando Rego](fernando_rego.md) ([#95](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/95)) and then helped him implement automatic acceptance tests ([#127](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/127)). These tasks took a lot of effort to solve many of the technical difficulties that arose with integrating the acceptance tests library with react. I also created the github actions for frontend and backend tests ([#110](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/110)).
