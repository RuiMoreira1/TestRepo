# Factsheet for {{FirstName LastName}}

## Sprint 0

{{
Include here a short description of your best contributions during this sprint. You can link to observable evidence of your work if needed.

**Note 1**: Everywhere you see a {{ }} in this template, you should replace it with the appropriate information and remove the {{ }}.
**Note 2**: If, in this or any other description field, you link to a pull request or issue, include it in parenthesis with the respective number and a link, for example ([#1](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/1)). In general, ([#{{N}}](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/{{N}})). You can also link to specific commits, using the commit message's first line instead of a number, for example ([style: apply formatting of pylint+black+prettier+eslint](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/commit/e801802de4424d2bcfd0c7d9fcaeb0ceba8a476f)).
**Note 3**: If you want to mention a another person, write their first and last name as a link for their factsheet, for example [John Doe](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/blob/master/factsheets/john_doe.md).
**Note 4**: Fields like {{A|B}} mean that you should either write A or B. If you think none of them apply, ommit that field and clarify in the description field next to it.
