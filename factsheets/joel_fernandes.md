# Factsheet for Joel

## Sprint 0

In this sprint, I was mainly responsible for creating a production environment and configuring it. Not only this, but I also contributed together with [Andr√©](https://github.com/andrelds11) to writing the text on [how to run](../README.md#how-to-run) our project. I also reviewed every single user story and their acceptance tests while creating one myself. I also greatly influenced pull requests with comments and approves and I did create one myself [#2](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/2).

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

1. [#16](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/16) - Acceptance tests and review with [Pedro](https://github.com/Goncalerta)

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

1. [#2](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/2) which just opened react to access the HTTP port so our product is available in the WWW on the production environment.
2. I also contributed to [#7](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/7) for posting my factsheet and fix formatting issues along with some other issues.

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

I reviewed and commented on other pull requests in the meantime - [#3](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/5), [#5](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/5), [#6](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/6), [#7](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/7), [#11](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/11) and [#13](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/13). In these threads, I commented on the code and the issues that were being fixed while discussing other issues and gave my opinion on some topics of general interest to our project.

I created a google cloud account and familiarized myself with how a VPS works and learned how to install all the docker dependencies and how to open the firewall to port 80. With all of this, we made our application available [here](http://35.230.144.250/). This will be the place where we will do all the future demonstrations of our product.
