# Factsheet for Jo√£o Marinho

## Sprint 0

During the project's initial phase, I underwent the Surrogate Product Owner role in my team. This included being the middleware, alongside the other SPOs, between the actual Product Owner and the remaining team members.
On the other hand, I fully believe one of my best efforts was the contribution to the identification and maintenance of the end resulting User Stories.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

-   [#42](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/42) (Implemented) - I was responsible for designing the User Story prototypes.
-   [#27](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/27) (Implemented) - I was responsible for designing the User Story prototypes, although being changed to a work item before the end of the sprint.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

-   [#1](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/1) (Reviewed) - Project's setup pull request, including docker commands, frontend, and backend structure.

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

-   The hard effort to attend meetings with the other SPOs so that the information passed on to the other team members was clear and consistent.
-   The creation of the navbar component variants in Figma so that changes in the prototype are more easily maintained.

## Sprint 1

The SPO role was not as notorious in this sprint as in the last one. My focus was on the development of the frontend of the project, being responsible for the User Story regarding the deletion of a service ([#16](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/16)). I was also part of the process of structuring the layout of each frontend page and the client-side routing.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

-   [#16](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/16) (Implemented) - Frontend part of User Story. It includes, additionally, a form to be used in the creation/editing of a service.
-   [#98](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/98) (Implemented) - Setup of the frontend router and the navbar to be included on every page.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

-   [#94](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/94) (Implemented) - Pull request relative to issue [#16](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/16).
-   [#69](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/69) (Implemented) - Pull request relative to issue [#98](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/98).

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

-   Substantial efforts in the early phase of the frontend development, to keep the code consistent and well-structured between groups. This was achieved through various calls with other project members.
-   Creating the main Services Page, alongside [Beatriz Aguiar](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/blob/master/factsheets/beatriz_aguiar.md), both front and back-end. This belongs to the issue [#15](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/15).
