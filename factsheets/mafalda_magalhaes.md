## Sprint 1

During sprint 1, I worked mostly with the backend development of our project, since I was assigned to the issue that was responsible for creating the database model [#55](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/55). Apart from this, I helped my colleagues with some bugs and technical discussions regarding our database and our tests. I also created a survey in order to measure our software development measures and collect some data to fill this part of our documentation.
