# Factsheet for Tiago Silva

## Sprint 0

During this first sprint, as a surrogate product owner (SPO), and in cooperation with the other SPOs, we worked as team to translate the product owner's (PO) desires/requirements into user stories to plan the work for the next sprint. Furthermore, I worked on the conceptual model of the project and wrote the acceptance tests for some of the service user stories ([#22](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/22), [#28](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2028-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/28), [#39](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/39), [#42](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/42)).

At the end of the sprint, I worked on the template for the user stories with other teammates and then created on GitHub the user stories that I mentioned before.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

-   [#22](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/22) as I wrote its acceptance tests
-   [#39](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/39) as I wrote its acceptance tests

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

-   [#8](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/8) as I wrote, with other teammates, the template for the user stories
-   [#2](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/2) as I reviewed the work done by other teammates

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

-   All the work that was done as a team, from the communication that we had to had, to the organization to guarantee the best efforts of each member.

-   All the work that was done with the other SPOs to ensure that the team was always in conformation and updated with all the news that were appearing.

## Sprint 1

During sprint 1, together with my teammates, I was responsible for starting the development of the scheduler generator using `or-tools`. At the start, we aimed to make the generator capable of generating schedules without any restrictions during the sprint. However, in order to make it more credible, we ended up developing it taking into consideration some restrictions as:

-   **No worker can work back-to-back shifts** (demanded by PO)
-   **No worker can work during the day if they worked that night before** (mentioned by PO in the initial meeting)
-   **The number of workers allocated to a shift must be exactly the demand of that shift**
-   **Working hours should try to be balanced out between workers**

Furthermore, I tried to review the pull requests of my teammates, whenever possible, to accept them faster.

### The two users that that I am most proud of

-   [#42](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/42) Implemented - Implemented the schedule generation.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

-   [#119](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/119) Implemented - Implemented the schedule generation.

-   [#102](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/102) Implemented - Fixed the domain model classes in django to incorporate the CanWork class.

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

-   I was responsible for creating the script for populating the database with [Rodrigo Tuna](https://github.com/rodrigotuna), so that the schedule generation could be tested.
-   I helped some of the members of team 3 developing their work, as I knew how they could do what they needed [#131](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/131).
