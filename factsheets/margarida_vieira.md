# Factsheet for Margarida Vieira

## Sprint 0

Given that the main focus of this sprint was setting up the various tools that will be used throughout the project's development as well as the guidelines for their use, the SPOs and SMs deserve special recognition for their remarkable organization and availability.

In terms of my contribution, I intervened at the level of the Person, User, and Admin user story mockups.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

Only at the beginning of the sprint 1 were the user stories created. However, I was involved in creating the mockups for the user stories [#15](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/15) and [#26](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/26).

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

I did not implement any PR.

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

For this particular sprint, it is not anything more relevant that I can think of to say.

## Sprint 1

I was assigned with the issue [#21](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/21).

Regarding the backend of the issue, I implemented the django Model, Sequelizer and ViewSet (creating the GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH, AND PUT requests) for Shift, in collaboration with [André Pereira](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/blob/master/factsheets/andre_pereira.md), member of my team.

As for the frontend, the issue involved two pages: the one for listing all the shifts of the specified workstation, and the one with the form for actually creating the shift and adding it to the respective workstation. I implemented the last one, with focus on the form and all the logic and functionality involved, from fields' validation and errors' verification to communication with the backend by sending the request and completing the shift's creation. Besides, I made sure the form could also be used for edition purposes.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

-   [#21](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/21) (Implemented) - took part on the implementation of both the backend and the frontend of the issue, as aforementioned.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

-   [#83](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/83) (Collaborated w/) - collaborated with [André Pereira](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/blob/master/factsheets/andre_pereira.md) in the development of the backend routes for the Shift model.

-   [#97](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/97) (Implemented) - added the possibility of restricting the returned shifts to a specified workstation.

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

-   I made an effort to be aware of the overall project's development status and reviewed various PR's.
