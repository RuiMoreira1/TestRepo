# Factsheet for Adriano Soares

## Sprint 0

During this sprint, I was responsible for writing the acceptance test for the user story [#23 - Login into the platform](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/23), as well as reviewing the user stories from User and Admin actors and inserting mockups to some user stories that didn't have them. Furthermore, I implemented a GitHub action that verifies code format, through the Black and Prettier formatters, and code correctness, through the Pylint and ESLint linters, blocking any pull request for the Master branch if such standards aren't met (pull request [#3 - Configure formatters and linters and respective github actions](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/3)).

## Sprint 1

During this sprint I was mainly responsible (but not limited to) for the frontend portion of user stories [#17](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/17) and [#18](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/18) whose objective was the creation and deletion of Staff members. Furthermore, I wrote the API specification for the aforementioned USs ([#125](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/126)) and coordinated Team 1's work.
