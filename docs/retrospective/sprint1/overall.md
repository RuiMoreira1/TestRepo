# Overall Retrospective (Sprint 1)

Goal: The main goal of this sprint was to have a functional prototype that allowed the generation of a schedule with some restrictions.

## Insights

### What went well

-   Good collaboration between different teams
-   Good communication between different teams
-   Backoffice and DevOps tasks were well done
-   Pull requests reviews were thorough and constructive

### What do we want to do differently

-   Improve communication with PO
-   Better time allocation
-   Reduce user stories dependencies
-   Solve problems with linters so that they are not a hindrance to development

### Ideas

-   Break user stories into smaller work items that can be shared between multiple user stories, removing dependencies
-   Establish earlier deadlines
-   Disable GitHooks, linters and formatters must be run individually, GitHub Actions prevent pull requests from reaching `dev` and `master` branches with errors

### Appreciations

-   Good communication between teams
-   Collaboration between teams

## Action Points

### Start doing

-   Establish better common guidelines for the usage of linters and formatters

### Stop doing

-   Starting the development half way through the sprint

### Continue doing

-   Good communication between teams
-   Collaboration between teams
