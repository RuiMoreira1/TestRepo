# Factsheet for Eunice Amorim

## Sprint 0

As a surrogate product owner, Iâ€™m really proud of the direct contact with the PO, especially the last meeting to approve the final user stories, mock ups and acceptance tests. Besides I worked in the writing of the user stories and the acceptance test for user and admin. Also I wrote the security concerts and investigated unit testing for django.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

-   [#26](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/26) as I wrote its acceptance tests
-   [#30](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/30) as it is one of ones that I wrote

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

-   [#4](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/4) as my comment provided a section "Notes" in the user story template
-   [#11](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/11) as my comment help to find a concensus in the architectural model.

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

-   The last minute meeting with prof. Tiago Boldt
-   The refinements of the user stories and its acceptance testing

## Sprint 1

In this sprint, beside my work as a surrogate product owner, I was able to develop the creation and removal of staff members ([#114](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/114), [#118](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/118), [#121](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/121), etc.). As a SPO, I kept in touch with the PO, for example, by sending the hapiness meter and asking doubts about impllementation.
