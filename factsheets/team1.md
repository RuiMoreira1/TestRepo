## Sprint 1

During this sprint our team implemented USs [#17](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/17), [#18](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/18), [#19](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/19) and [#20](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/20). Additionally, we set up the staging environment server and GitHub actions that, upon a push to the branch `master` or `dev`, deploy the Docker image into the development server and staging server, respectivelly. Moreover, we implemented app telemetry ([#104](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/104)), created a template for the documentation of the factsheets ([#59](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/59)), corrected the documentation of the previous sprint ([#107](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/107) and [#58](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/58)) and documented the API operations needed to implement the previously mentioned USs ([#126](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/126) and [#93](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/93)).
