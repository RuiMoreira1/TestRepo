# Retrospective for Team 4 (Sprint 1)

have a prototype that has some functionality and is ready to show for the po

## Insights

### What went well

-   Working not only on US's but also on additional key points of an healthy code base
-   Good communication between people
-   PRs are reviewed by the class, and by not only members of the same team
-   Team developed their work despite dependencies between each team

### What do we want to do differently

-   Not work only during the second week of the sprint
-   Make PR revisions more dynamic
-   Decrease dependency between US's
-   Timely help with blocking problems
-   Work on US's story points estimation, which are still lacking in accuracy

### Ideas

-   Elaborate a Definition of Done and make sure issues abide by that
-   Meetings or touch points between people of different teams and within the same team

### Appreciations

-   People's availability and dedication to the work
-   People's compromise to the task they have taken up

## Action Points

### Start doing

-   Distribute tasks more equitably during the sprint, making a conscious effort to work during the whole two weeks
-   Have a clear vision of which US's take prioritiy and have those being worked on first, reducing bottlenecks due to dependencies

### Stop doing

-   Have the same people reviewing the PR's. This is not a good practice, as it can lead to bias and a lack of objectivity

### Continue doing

-   Despite problems, continue reviewing PR's
-   Continue communicating through discord and github.
