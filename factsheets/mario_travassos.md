# Factsheet for MÃ¡rio Travassos

## Sprint 0

During sprint 0, I was responsible for writing the acceptance test for the user story [#15 - Create new service](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/15), and writing the documentation for both the development guide and the "how to contribute" section of the project's README document. Additionally, I created a pull request with the intent of merging the development documentation with the remainder of the project in the main branch.

Furthermore, I also took part in reviewing all the acceptance tests, user stories and documentation assigned to my team, alongside my fellow team members.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

This can include user stories that you have written or refined during the sprint. If it was a refinement, explain what you have added or changed.

-   Wrote the acceptance test for the user story [#15 - Create new service](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/15)

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

-   [#44 - docs: add development documentation](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/44) as I created this pr, merging our work in the development documentation with the remainder of the project.

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

-   The refinements of the user stories and their respective acceptance tests, alongside the remainder of my team
-   Help provided in deciding the project's tech stack, and in explaining to some of my colleagues how these technologies work and interact, helping the team make a more informed decision.

## Sprint 1

During sprint 1, I was responsible for developing the frontend for the workstation page, as well as other components related to that, including but not limited to some forms, and a reusable message box which will come in handy with the reminder.

Additionally, I developed an early version of the main App component, as well as a simple template for the navbar, in order to ease the development of the other teams and groups. I have also kept their work in check, providing them with important info to aid them in solving their problems, as well as making sure their code and folder structure is consistent with what is defined in our documentation, and with what the other groups are writing.

Furthermore, I also refactored and cleaned up code developed by other groups, in order to make it perform better, more readable, or to make for a better user experience overall.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

-   Developed the full code necessary to implement the functionality described in the [#129 - feat: implement MessageBox component ](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/129) user story. This was an opportunity to learn more about the power of React.js, as I was able to take advantage of its flexibility to, say, pass state handlers to other components, and manage state of a component inside another one. It also required me to study the api and its implementation on the backend.

-   Implemented the functionality described in the user story [#122 - refactor: search form](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/122). This required me to understand the implementation of the search form that was already present, and to delve into my co-workers' code, so as to standardize the search form.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

-   I created a pull request to merge code developed by members of my team into the development branch, which was PR [feat: implement staff creation #114](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/114). Some refactoring was necessary in that code, which I handled. Additionally, I had to resolve some conflicts with code already existent in the development branch. Fixing these conflicts involved learning how the code in the backend of the application worked, since that was where most of these were situated.

-   I created a pull request to merge code developed by members of my team into the development branch, which was PR [feat: implements workstation adding #113](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/113). I developed most of the code in it. I had to refactor the code inside this branch to reflect some design decisions of my colleagues, and that unfortunately forced me to prehemptively merge the branch present in the aforementioned pull request (#114), before that pull request could be merged into the development branch. This meant we had to be extra careful in accepting both of these pull requests, and I had to get acquainted with how git's merging and rebasing worked, besides having to develop the actual code.

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

-   Helping other groups in their frontend development in solving problems, giving them tips to improve their code, and actively refactoring and cleaning their code to make it better.
-   Paying attention to my coworkers' pull requests, and reviewing, commenting and performing changes in the code as necessary.
