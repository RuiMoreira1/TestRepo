# Factsheet for Tiago Rodrigues

## Sprint 0

For the first sprint, I handled the writing of the project's architecture and deployment diagrams, explaining the pros and cons of each of the choices made. Besides this, as Scrum Master for my team, I wrote the factsheet for our team, and helped distribute the workload between all members.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

Even though my team wrote the acceptance tests for some user stories, I did not take part in that task.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

-   [#11](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/11) (Refined) - Gave insight on how the deployment should look like
-   [#13](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/13) (Refined) - Simplified some of the general architecture.

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

-   As I was tasked with writing the justification for the architecture and design, I am happy with how it turned out.

-   Also, I strived to keep simplicity to a maximum during the project's conception, trying to reduce clutter whilst keeping the overall product aligned with the end goals.

## Sprint 1

In this sprint I was tasked with implementing the e-mail service for our backend. I used the Sendinblue API to achieve this, as we don't have a specific need to use a SMTP server yet.
