# Factsheet for Andr√© Santos

## Sprint 0

During the sprint 0 I was responsible for writing the how to run guide, creating some acceptance tests and reviewing the whole process as a team. My colleague Joel took the lead trying to deploy the app to serve as a production environment and I documented the whole task sequence.

### The user story acceptance test that I am most proud of:

The [#24](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/24), responsible for the user logout operation. I also contributed to the [#16](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/16), responsible for the service deletion. The whole team then reviewed and changed the acceptance tests inferring some consistency.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

I did not review any pull requests this sprint.

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

Even though we spent some hours trying out the server deployment, and the Google Cloud Service looked difficult in the beginning, I am quite proud and happy that I understood how it worked and that we managed to execute it. In the end, it wasn't as hard as it seemed.

### Technical Soundness

### Product Realization

### Value for the Client

## Sprint 1

During the sprint 1 our team split into 2 teams, minbe being responsible for the create and delete staff user stories. Those tasks involved the pages frontend and backend modules. I took most part in the backend section, however, I also helped in the connection with react. I'm really proud of the steps taken in the learning process because initially I didn't know a thing about django, specially the rest api. After putting time into it I now know a fair chunk about the technology. It was also a great sensation to solve the issues we had with the database and the connection with react.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of:

-The [#17](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/17), responsible for the staff creation and general visualization.
-The [#18](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/18), responsible for the staff deletion.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

-The [#127](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/127)
-The [#102](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/102)

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

This sprint I did not spend any particular time outside the two previously refered issues. The contribution I am more proud of was working in the solving of the database issues together with other students.

### Technical Soundness

### Product Realization

### Value for the Client
