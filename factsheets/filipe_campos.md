# Factsheet for Filipe Campos

## Sprint 0

During this initial sprint I was responsible for designing the mockups for user stories [#19](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/19) and [#20](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/20), these ended up being altered due to PO feedback, and didn't make it to the final issue. I also tested, reviewed and approved the following pull requests: [#1](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/1), [#4](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/4), [#12](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/1), [#13](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/13), [#37](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/37), [#43](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/43)

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

-   [#19](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/19) (Wrote) - Designed mockups for this user story.
-   [#20](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/20) (Wrote) - Designed mockups for this user story.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

I personally only created a single pull request during Sprint 0:

-   [#38](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/38) (Implemented) - Fixes problem with line endings across operating systems

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

-   Imported the elements of the chosen [bootstrap theme](https://bootswatch.com/flatly/) to Figma, increasing the mockup quality and development speed.
-   Setup project board views for each of the teams, allowing the quick identification of the current status of each team.

## Sprint 1

During this sprint I was responsible for specifying and developing the backend API of the schedule browsing feature. Compared to other backend views, schedules don't map directly to a single database relation, therefore django rest framework's automatic routing couldn't be applied. This lead to more complex logic that had to be thoroughly tested.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

-   [#22](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/22) (Implemented) - Developed the backend logic necessary to implement this user story.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

-   [#77](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/77) (Implemented) - Specified the API for the schedule browsing feature.
-   [#91](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/91) (Implemented) - Backend implementation of the schedule browsing feature.

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

-   Tested, reviewed and approved multiple pull requests throughout the sprint ([#56](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/56),[#59](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/59),[#61](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/61),[#66](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/66),[#83](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/83),[#106](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/106),[#107](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/107), [#108](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/108)).
-   Helped troubleshoot local project setup issues, more specifically, in the execution of the docker containers.
