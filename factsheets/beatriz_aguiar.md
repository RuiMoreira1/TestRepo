# Factsheet for Beatriz Aguiar

## Sprint 0

Worked as the team 3's Scrum Master, being responsible for the management and organization of the team. Nevertheless, I was also in charge of creating three service mockups, namely: Service one, two and three. The latter are present in the correspondent User Stories ([#29](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/29), [#18](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/18), [#17](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/17)).

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

-   [#29](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/29) (Implemented) - created mockup
-   [#17](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/17) (Implemented) - created mockup

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

I haven't done any pull requests. However, I would like to highlight the [docker setup pull request](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/1) for its efficiency.

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

Splitting up the issues for the different teams during the Scrum Master's meeting and setting up figma's structure alongside [Margarida Vieira](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/blob/master/factsheets/margarida_vieira.md) and [Henrique Sousa](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/blob/master/factsheets/joao_marinho.md).

## Sprint 1

Divided the issues and assigned them to the team 3's members, as Scrum Master. Also tried to be updated about the whereabouts of each member to guaratee the success of the sprint.

I was assigned with the backend of the issue [#15](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/15). I implimented the django models, sequelizers and viewSet, creating the GET POST DELETE PATCH AND PUT requests. Ended up implementing the all service backend but it was relatively fast and once the pull request was accepts, I pursued to implement other work items that appeared along the way.

I implemented the i18n feature [#81](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/81), internationalizing the website to the languages PT and EN. Also created a NOT FOUND page [#92](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/92) , fixed the navbar collapse toggler [#85](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/85), and helped [João Marinho](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/blob/master/factsheets/joao_marinho.md) to implement the modal of the delete service page [#94](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/94).

-   [#16](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/16) (Refined) - implemented the confirmation pop-up modal
