## Sprint 1

In this sprint I keep on doing my job as a SPO wich required a lot of effort. Additionally I have lead the weighing of the US, the PO meeting, distributed the US to each team and assign the respective ones to the team 4's members.

During this sprint I have also helped a lot of people in their first steps with either django and react, by building a first example of a database modal, exploring and help decided how the api calls will be done, share information to other teams that needed it.

The thing that I am most proud of is the 21 reviews that I have done, wich improved my global knowledge of the project while keeping the development flowing.
