# Factsheet for Team 3

## Sprint 0

During this sprint, our team was in charge of creating the Services' User Stories mock-ups, consisting of 14 mock-ups in total. Initially, we worked alongside team 1 to guarantee consistency and uniformity.
The prototypes are crucial for the Product Owner to perceive the final product while giving us approval.

### The four user stories that we are most proud of

As we only worked with mock-ups, the USs we are more proud of are the ones which mock-ups are the more complex.

-   [#17](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/17) (Implemented) - created mockup
-   [#20](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/20) (Implemented) - created mockup
-   [#42](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/42) (Implemented) - created mockup
-   [#22](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/22) (Implemented) - created mockup

### The four pull requests that we are most proud of

We do not believe this field is relevant for Sprint 0.

### Four other contributions that we are especially proud of

As previously mentioned, our team was assigned to the creation of mock-ups, however, this was not the more challenging nor the most interesting part of Sprint 0. The initial coordination and co-work with the other teams is something we would like to highlight throughout these 4 weeks.

## Sprint 1
