# Retrospective for Team 1 (Sprint 1)

Goal: The main goal of this sprint was having a functional prototype that allowed the generation of a schedule with some restrictions. This team focused on the creation and removal of staff members and workstations.

## Insights

### What went well

-   The comunication between team members was good
-   The commitment of all the members was inspiring even in non functional tasks (e.g. deployment and stagging servers, template documentation and github actions)
-   The division of the work among the team was fair

### What do we want to do differently

-   Start individual development earlier
-   Improve estimation of the USs
-   Improve team meeting scheduling
-   Decrease dependency between USs
-   Have more time with all members present

### Ideas

-   Divide US in even smaller work items in order to decrease dependencies
-   Establish team work deadlines a few days earlier
-   Schedule one 20 minute weekly meeting for knowlegde sharing

### Appreciations

-   Commitment of all the members of the team
-   Help among the team and between other class teams

## Action Points

### Start doing

-   Schedule one 20 minute weekly meeting for knowlegde sharing
-   Establish team work deadlines two days earlier than sprint conclusion

### Stop doing

-   Starting the development in the second week of the sprint

### Continue doing

-   Continue the daily mutual help
-   Continue daily team comunication on discord
