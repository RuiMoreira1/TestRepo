### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

-   No other relevant contribution not already mentioned.

## Sprint 1

During sprint 1, I was responsible for implementing the schedule generation, using or-tools with no restrcitions. The generation ended up having some minor restricions in order for it to be credible, such as: **No worker can work back-to-back shifts** (demanded by PO), **No worker can work during the day if they worked the night before**(mentioned by PO in the intial meeting), **The number of workers allocated to a shift must be exactly the demand of that shift**, **Working hours should try to be balanced out between workers**.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

-   [#42](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/42) Implemented - Implemented the schedule generation.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

-   [#119](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/119) Implemented - Implemented the schedule generation.

-   [#102](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/102) Implemented - Fixed the domain model classes in django to incorporate the CanWork class.

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

-   I was responsible for creating the script for populating the database with [Tiago Silva](https://github.com/TiagoCaldaSilva), so that the schedule generation could be tested.
-   I reviewed and requested changes on PR [#120](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/120).
