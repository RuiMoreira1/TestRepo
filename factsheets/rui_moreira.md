# Factsheet for Rui Moreira

## Sprint 0

For the first sprint, I handled the creation of the project's architecture and component diagrams, following several guidelines regarding our project's end goals. Besides this, as a team member, I held a key part in structuring our initial project setup goals and in building some standard and consistent principles to aid our development process.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

Even though my team wrote the acceptance tests for some user stories, I did not take part in this particular task.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

-   [#3](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/3) (Reviewed)
-   [#46](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/46) (Implemented)

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

-   I'm responsible for designing the architecture and the components diagram. And I'm happy how it turned out, the discussion that led to a more clear definition of our product and of our end goal. Even though, the high level architecture, that has a different scale and complexity, won't be used for our project, had interesting discussion's and feedback from the entire class.

## Sprint 1

I was assigned to the backend development regarding issue [#42](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/42). I also tracked down the best ways of implementing and integrating a job queue in Django, which will be available in future deliverables, to improve user experience.

### The two user stories that I am most proud of

-   [#42](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/issues/42) (Implemented) - Implemented the backend of Generate Schedule with minor restrictions, using Google Or-Tools python integration.

### The two pull requests that I am most proud of

-   [#119](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/119) (Implemented) (Note: I committed with 2 different accounts RMoreiraFD and RuiMoreira1)
-   [#91](https://github.com/FEUP-MEIC-DS-2022-1MEIC03/shift_planner_project/pull/91) (Reviewed)

### Two other contributions that I am especially proud of

-   It was discussed in previous classes that we should investigate and flag the dependencies between User Stories and work items. This wasn't done this sprint, leading to a bit of drama, confusion, and the typical finger-pointing (Who did this?)! But I think I successfully contributed to having this checked before the task distribution in the next sprint.
-   I helped the general class to achieve better code quality and consistency, and avoid unnecessary code hammering, especially when it comes to configuration files. I also started a few healthy discussions, to get feedback and contribution from all the teams regarding future technologies/libraries we are planning on using for future deliverables.
