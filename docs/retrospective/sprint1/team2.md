# Retrospective for Team 2 (Sprint 1)

Goal: The goal for our team was to develop a prototype that could successfully generate a schedule with some minor restrictions.

## Insights

### What went well

-   The team members could communicate effectively
-   The workload was balanced appropriately
-   All the assigned work was completed, with great effort and cooperation between all members

### What do we want to do differently

-   Start the development of some features earlier
-   Keep in mind the static analysis tools and run them more often
-   Decrease the dependencies between the different user stories and work items.

### Ideas

-   Break the user stories into even smaller work items
-   Discuss the dependencies between the different items before assigning them to distribute them accordingly

### Appreciations

-   The effort all team members put into their work
-   The successful completion of a high effort user story
-   The good communication and division of work between everyone

## Action Points

### Start doing

-   Run linters at the end of every work session
-   Give 1/2 days exclusively for testing

### Stop doing

-   Starting development late
-   Not running linters and analysis tools

### Continue doing

-   Communicating efficiently between everyone
-   Reviewing Pull Requests and work items
-   Helping each other
